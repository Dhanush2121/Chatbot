# Chatbot
This project focuses on implementing a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to handle various user queries and provide appropriate responses based on trained conversational data. The project utilizes Streamlit as the front-end interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot via a web-based application.
